I will be going over some of my recommendations for places to visit and what to keep in mind while in Japan (like manners and stuff)

## Why you should listen to me
Well if you are reading this chances are you are my friend, isn't that enough? 
If you are one of my GSoC mentors, or someone else, I have lived in Japan for 6 months and travelled to plenty of places.

## What you should know when in Japan (and how to blend in)
### 1. Public Transportation is king
   - Unless you are planning on going somewhere really remote, I highly suggest **NOT** renting a car and just use the public transportation
   - If you are arriving in Tokyo, get a [Pasmo Card](https://www.pasmo.co.jp/visitors/en/normalpasmo/) or a [Welcome Suica Card](https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/welcomesuica/welcomesuica.html) for transit, 
    you can not only use them for all (well, almost all) public transportation, but you can also use it to pay in tons of places in urban centers.
   If your credit card have an internation fee, this is a great way to get around it.
### 2. Try to not eat while walking
   - It is considered bad manner, but drinking is fine though
   - It's not like you are going to get a fine or anything like that but just try to keep it in mind
### 3. Sunglasses are rare
   - You will stand out if you wear them, unless you are white, people might think you are with the Yakuza (jk)
### 4. Try to carry some cash at all times
   - Although rarer these days, in some places, especially in the countryside/less urban areas, shops/restaurants will only accept cash
   - ATMs on the street usually only take cash, but some in train stations will take IC Cards
### 5. Low on Cash? Go to 711 ATMS
   - They usually have ok rates and will accept any debit card
### 6. You see Tatami? Take off your shoes!
   - If you see an elevated floor, chances are you have to take off your shoes
### 7. You don't have to purchase Shinkansen/Bullet train tickets in advance
   - Between major centres (like Tokyo and Osaka), they come every 5 minutes! You can buy it right in the station if you want
   - However, the cheapest way to travel is actually through overnight busses, which you have to purchase in advance
### 8. Umbrellas are way, way more common than hoodies
   - When there's rain, hoodies are pretty sure, I think it's because they are out of fashion in Japan but feel free to wear them
### 9. SHAVE
   - In Japan, if you are an Asian, unshaved beard makes you seem messy
### 10. If you decide to Drive, drive on LEFT SIDE
   - Even if you don't this is still a good thing to keep in mind
